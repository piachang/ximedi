# About Ximedi

I am a Chilean animal physician who also swims and draws. I draw by pleasure, and maybe youâ€™d like the stuff I make.

Art, an open water life, and animal rights issues are my main interests, so, in the illustrated dive I take on this Blog, these are the main subjects. If you like my work, it would be awesome if you donate to one of the organizations I believe help to make a change for the better.
