        La Mer and the great Wave.

        How we envision a timeless collaboration between two great artists:
        Hokusai and Debussy

        Dew and mold,
        damp soil,
        dust reflected in thin light rays,
        my boyfriend playing the piano in his pijamas,
        soft skin with a velvety facial hair, like my grand mother's.
        Music that emerges behind a water curtain.
        All the delicated and romantic stuff I recall.

        That's Debussy to me.

        Because of that, the first time I heard La Mer

        I was shocked

        I thought it was so meditative and contemplative

        I felt like observing some Turner's marine art

        I felt I was hearing the change of the ocean and it's flows

        From the outside.
        From the shore.

        I guess that is what it fulls to appreciate the big wave of Kanagawa. Reading it from the right to the left. The boats look up at the threatening wall of water.
        The blank spaces of the foam. A thousand little fingers. Prussian blue and exagerated bidimensional projection of a wave imposible to avoid.

        An image in our imagination. The minute after the great wave rises it's already burst.

        La mer has three movements.

        De l'aube Ã  midi sur la mer - From the evening to noon in the sea

        Jeux de vagues - Wave games

        Dialogue du vent et de la mer - Dialogue of the wind and the sea
